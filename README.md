# RxFileMonitor

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

RxSwift `Observable` wrapper for CoreFoundation file system events.

## Usage

The most convenient usage is through the RxSwift `Observable` exposed in the module as:

```swift
Monitoring.folderMonitor(url: URL) -> Observable<FolderContentChangeEvent>
```

You use it on a folder and will be notified about ...

- changes to the folder itself, and
- changes to any item inside it (not including sub-folders).

Example:

```swift
import RxFileMonitor

let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
let folderUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/monitor/")

Monitoring.folderMonitor(url: folderUrl)
    .subscribe(onNext: { event in
        print("Folder contents changed at \(event.url) (\(event.change))")
    })
    .addDisposableTo(disposeBag)
```

### Reacting to file content changes only

Say you want to update a cache of a folder's notes' contents, you'll be interested in files only:

```swift
let changedFile = Monitoring.folderMonitor(url: folderUrl)
    // Files only ...
    .filter { $0.change.contains(.isFile) }
    // ... except the Spotlight cache.
    .filter { $0.filename != ".DS_Store" }
    .map { $0.filename }
    .observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
```

Now you will want to update the cache for the changed file:

```swift
changedFile.subscribe(onNext: cache.updateFile)
```

Or if you simply rebuild the whole cache when anything changed, you can stop after filtering for accepted events:

```swift
let changedFile = Monitoring.folderMonitor(url: folderUrl)
    .filter { $0.change.contains(.isFile) }
    .filter { $0.filename != ".DS_Store" }
    .observeOn(MainScheduler.instance)
    .subscribe(onNext: { _ in 
        cache.rebuild()
    })
```
